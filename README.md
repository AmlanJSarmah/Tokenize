# Tokenize
Tokenize is a token generation system where one can generate a token (say a request) and publish it to a central pool, a token is a request with a `from` and `to` tag. One can accept the token and the person who accepted the token and also the person who raised the token gets each other's contact details. A request can be anything like "Get my Parcel".
